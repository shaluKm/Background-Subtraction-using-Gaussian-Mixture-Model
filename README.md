# Background-Subtraction-using-Gaussian-Mixture-Model
This project implements background subtraction using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Background is extracted from training frames through frame averaging and GMM, allowing for effective isolation of foreground objects in test frames by subtracting the background.
